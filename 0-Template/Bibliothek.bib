@misc{kuhn_code_2015,
  title = {Code Mesh 2015 - Reactive Design Patterns},
  abstract = {Our software needs to become reactive, this realization is widely understood: we need to consider responsiveness, maintainability, elasticity and scalability from the outset. Not all systems need to implement all these to the same degree, specific project requirements will determine where effort is most wisely spent, but in the vast majority of cases the need to go reactive will demand that we design our applications differently.

In this presentation we explore several architecture elements that are commonly found in reactive systems (like the circuit breaker, various replication techniques, or flow control protocols). These patterns are language agnostic and also independent of the abundant choice of reactive programming frameworks and libraries, they are well-specified starting points for exploring the design space of a concrete problem: thinking is strictly required!},
