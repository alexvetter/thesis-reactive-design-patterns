This thesis discusses which Design Patterns fulfil the properties of the Reactive Manifesto. The aim of this thesis is to identify Design Pattern which are useful in case of developing a reactive system.
At first the new requirements related to software systems will be explained. The new requirements are also the motivation behind the Reactive Manifesto and this thesis.
The following section describes the foundations of the reactive properties, the need for parallelism \& concurrency, as well as the ideas behind functional programming.
The main parts cover a selection of Design Patterns, which will be described in detail towards the Reactive Manifesto. The Patterns are classified according to  their purpose. Furthermore, two concurrency models are circumstantiated, which are highly useful for reactive systems.
At the end some personal estimations are phrased in which areas reactive systems could be most reasonable and a summary of the work.
