\section{Eigenschaften reaktiver Systeme}

By means of an asynchronous, non-blocking message-driven approach, highly resilient and elastic systems can be formed, resulting in a consistently responsive user experience. In other words the system needs to be message-driven in order to be elastic and resilient which results in an responsive application.

\begin{quotation}
Without resilience, nothing else matters. If your beautiful, production-grade, elastic, scalable, highly concurrent, non-blocking, asynchronous, highly responsive and performant application isn't running, then you're back to square one. It starts and ends with resilience.~\citetext{Bon√©r, Jones; 2015}
